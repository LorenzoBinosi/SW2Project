\section{Introduction}\label{sec introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

This is the  Requirement Analysis and Specification Document for the PowerEnJoy car-sharing service.
Its purpose is to completely describe the system, its components, functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and relationships with the external world, and to provide typical use cases and scenarios for all the actors involved. It is also a strong baseline for project planning and cost estimization, for software evaluation and change control.


This document is written for project managers, developers, testers and systems analysts. Users are not generally interested in detailed software requirements, but they can still find it useful. It may be used in a contractual requirement.

\subsection{Scope}

PowerEnJoy is a digital management system for a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric car. This car rental system provides an alternative solution to public transport, thus being not only eco-friendly, but also simple and reliable.

The service is available to whomever has a valid driving license. Anybody who wants to register must provide a copy of it, along with his credentials and payment informations.
Once registered, they will be allowed to search a car in a specific area, and reserve one for up to an hour before picking it up. The system will cancel the reservation in case of them failing to arrive to the car in time, will make that specific car available again and apply a fine to the driver.

Upon arrival to the car, the driver will be able to get inside and drive it, at the cost of a per-minute fee of which he will be notified by the system through a screen on the car itself; this until the car will be left parked in a safe area, where the system will close the doors and make the car available again.

A support team is provided by an external service in case of incidents, car failures and other cases of need.

\subsection{Goals}
The goals of the PowerEnJoy service are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {[G1]} Allow a driver to rent a car. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {[G1.1]} Allow a driver to search and reserve a car. 
		\item {[G1.2]} Allow a driver to use a reserved car. 
		\item {[G1.3]} Allow a driver to park a car in a safe area, suggested by the system.
	\end{itemize} 
	\item {[G2]} Allow a guest to sign up to the system. 
	\item {[G3]} Motivate a driver into car pooling. 
	\item {[G4]} Motivate a driver to a better behavior during the rent of a car. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}
This document is structured in three parts:
\begin{description}
	\item[\autoref{sec introduction}: Introduction.] It provides an overall description of the system scope and purpose, together with some information on this document.
	\item[\autoref{sec overall-desc}: Overall description.] Provides a broad perspective over the principal system features, constraints, and assumptions about the users and the environment.
	\item[\autoref{sec requirements}: Specific requirements.] Goes into detail about functional and nonfunctional requirements. This chapter is arranged by feature.
