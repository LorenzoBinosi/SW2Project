\subsection{System Features}

\subsubsection{Driver registration}

\subsubsubsection{Purpose}
Any guest can subscribe through web or mobile applications.

In both cases the guest has to fill a registration form and must agree to the personal data policy according to his/her country privacy laws, otherwise the registration request will be aborted.

As soon as the guest has submitted all the data, the system verifies the consistency of the information and a confirmation mail with a password is sent to the email address indicated in the registration form. The guest must confirm his/her email address to end the registration.

Once registered a guest can be recognized as a driver by logging in.

\subsubsubsection{Scenario 1}
Bob, a normal citizen without a car, has just discovered the existence of the PowerEnJoy service and wants to use it.

He opens the homepage of PowerEnJoy website and proceeds to register by clicking on the button "Sign up".

He fills in all the information required and authorises the personal data treatment. 

The system verifies all the information that bob submitted in the form and sends him a confirmation mail.

Bob checks his mailbox, opens the email and clicks on "Confirm email". He is also notified about his current password.

The system then informs Bob that he is successfully registered.

	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Search and reservation}

\subsubsubsection{Purpose}
Any logged driver, in possession of a valid driving license and a regular status of payments, can search and reserve a car through the web application or the mobile app.

The system shows a map, of the area nearby him/her, with the available cars represented as colorful markers. There are 3 diffent colors for the markers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item red: 25-50\% of battery charge
	\item yellow: 50-75\% of battery charge
	\item green: 75-100\% of battery charge
\end{itemize}
The driver can also search nearby cars from a given address through a search box on the page.

Once the driver chooses the car he can click on its marker and a new dynamic frame will show more informations about the car and the possibility to reserving it by clicking on the button "Reserve".
The system then notifies the driver that he/she succesfully reserved a car.

Cars with less charge than 25\% of battery charge require assistance to be recharged and the system won't show them as available to the drivers. 


\subsubsubsection{Scenario 1}
Bob logs in the PowerEnJoy application through his web browser. He wants to reserve a car because an important meeting is waiting for him. Once logged, the system redirects him to the homepage that now shows the car search page. Bob realizes there's only a car with a red marker within 1km from him. Bob has to hurry up so he clicks on the red marker and then on the button "Reserve". Bob has succesfully reserved the car and he get redirect to the reservation page.

\subsubsubsection{Scenario 2}
Alice logs in the PowerEnJoy application through his mobile phone. She wants to reserve a car but everytime she clicks on the button "Reserve" of an available car the system shows her a dynamic message box that remember her to solve her pending payments. Once any pending payments is solved she will be able to reserve an available car.

\end{figure}

\subsubsubsection{Associated functional requirements}

Interactions between system and driver occur through car or mobile applications.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The driver must be logged into the system in order to search and reserve a car.
	\item The system must show the driver a map of the area, within a 1km range from him/her or from a given address, with the available cars.
	\item The system must provide more informations about an available car. These informations are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item license plate
			\item address
			\item battery level
		\end{itemize}
	\item In order to reserve a car the driver's driving license mustn't be expired. \label{f-expired}
	\item In order to reserve a car the driver's status of payments must be regular. \label{f-regular}
	\item The system must prevent the driver from reserving more than one car at time.
	\item The system must prevent the driver from reserving a car already reserved, or in use by another driver.
	\item The system must prevent the driver from reserving an "Out\_of\_service" car.
	\item After a reservation is completed, the system automatically tags the reserved car as "Reserved".
	\item After a reservation is completed, the system automatically redirects the driver to the reservation page completed by with the reservation informations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Car usage}

\subsubsubsection{Purpose}
The driver can use the car after he/she reserved it.

When the driver is nearby the reserved car he/she can click the button "I'm nearby" on the mobile reservation page and the system will check the GPS signal of both the car and the driver's mobile phone, to assess if they are within a 25 meters range. If they are within that range, the system will unlock the car and the driver can enter it. This operation is available only through the mobile application.

As soon as the engine ignites, the system starts charging the driver for a given amount of money per minute; the driver is notified of the current charges through a screen on the car.

\subsubsubsection{Scenario 1}
Bob has already reserved a car and he is going to pick it up. He is about 50 meters from the car and he clicks the button "I'm nearby" on the mobile application. The system checks the GPS signal of both the car and Bob's mobile phone, and doesn't unlock the car notifying Bob that he's too far from the car.

Once Bob is in front of the car he clicks again on "I'm nearby", the system unlocks the car and he can finally enter.

Bob starts the car and the system notifies him about his current charges through the car application. He can start his ride.

\end{figure}

\subsubsubsection{Associated functional requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The driver can only use the mobile application to unlock the car. 
	\item From the reservation to the unlocking of the car must not pass more than one hours. Otherwise the system will tag again the car as "Available". The driver is notified about the end of the rental operation.\label{f-reservationcanc}
	\item The system checks the GPS signal of both the car and driver's mobile phone, to assess if they are within a 25 meters range. If they are within that range, the system will unlock the car. \label{f-nearby}
	\item The driver must enter in the car to start it.
	\item The system will start charging the driver once he/she starts the car.
	\item Once the car is unlocked, the system tags it as "In\_use".
	\item The car application must notify the driver about current charging.	
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Car parking}

\subsubsubsection{Purpose}

Once the driver has finished using the car he/she should be able to park it in safe area provided by the system. These areas are displayed by the navigator car application.

After parking the car, the driver can exit from it. The system will lock the car and automatically charges the driver on the credit card indicated during the registration.

If a driver brought other people with him/her, he/she will get a 10\% discount on the final charge.

\subsubsubsection{Scenario 1}

Bob is almost at his important meeting. The GPS navigator application shows several parking areas and Bob chooses one of them to park his car. He checks if there's at least one available parking spot and he finds one. Once he turns off the car and gets out, the system stops charging him and he can finally enjoy his evening.

\end{figure}

\subsubsubsection{Associated functional requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The driver must park his/her car in a safe area.
	\item The driver must get out from the car remembering to close all doors and to roll up all windows of the car, otherwise the system won't stop charging him/her, and after 5 minutes will send him/her a sms notification to remember him/her that the rental operation can't be ended correctly.
	After 30 minutes the system tags the car as "Out\_of\_service" and it will apply a fee of 20 euros to the driver.
	\item Once the car is locked, the system must directly charge the driver via the previosly indicate payment method.
	\item Once the car is locked, the system must send a message to notify the driver about rental costs. The rental is now concluded. The reservation page will be cleared and closed by the system.
	\item Once the car is locked, the system checks its conditions. If battery power is lower  than 25\% or a component of it is not working correctly, the system must tag the car as "Out\_of\_service". Otherwise the system tags the car as "Available".
	\item Other requirements for G3 only are:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item car's sensors must detect correctly the number of passengers.
		\item if the driver is accompanied by at least one passenger during the whole ride, the system will apply him/her a direct discount of 10\%, otherwise there won't be any discount.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Service discounts and fees}

\subsubsubsection{Purpose}
During the rental of a car, the driver can be rewarded with discounts or punished with fines.
For instance, if a driver leaves a car with more than 50\% of battery charge, the system applies a discount of 20\% on the last ride.

\subsubsubsection{Scenario 1}

Bob is going too fast because he is late for his important meeting. He commits a serious infraction and gets a speeding ticket. The system pays his fine and directly charges him the same amount of the fine plus an addictional fee of 10 euros. Bob is not happy.

\subsubsubsection{Associated functional requirements}

Requirements for G4 are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Discounts must be applied one at time on total rental price excluding any fee or fine. The total rental price is updated everytime a discount is applied.
	\item Fines or fees are applied after any discount.
	\item If a driver doesn't pick up a reserved car within 1 hour, the system applies a fine of 1 euro.
	\item If a driver gets a fine, the system pays his/her fine and directly charges him/her by the same amount of the fine plus an addictional fee of 10 euros.
	\item If a driver leaves a car with more than 50\% of battery charge, the system applies a discount of 20\% on the last ride.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system must support at least 1000 connected driver at time.
	\item 95\% of requests must be processed in less than 5 s.
