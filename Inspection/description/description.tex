\section{Description of the code}

\subsection {Assigned class}

The assigned class is the \textbf{InjectNodeTrailCsvTransform} class which is located in the \texttt{org.apache.ofbiz.content.webapp.ftl} package of the Apache OFBiz project. In particular, it's a class of the Apache Freemarker Java library which allows to generate text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source code, etc.) based on templates and changing data.

\subsection {Functional role of the class}

The class implements the \textbf{TemplateTransformModel} public interface which contains the \texttt{getWriter} method. However, it provides also the following deprecated methods:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{getArg}
	\item \texttt{getWrappedObject}
\end{itemize}
Thanks to the \texttt{getWriter} method it is possible to transform an URL, which contains markers, into another one replacing the markers with provided arguments. 

Unfortunately, this class it's not documented and the lack of comments make the guessing of its role harder.
